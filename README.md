# LabVIEW-MSCL

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/LabVIEW-MSCL/releases/latest).

LabVIEW-MSCL is a VI package that provides an easy to implement LabVIEW interface to the .NET version of [MSCL](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/MSCL).

This add-on has helper VIs for many common methods and properties provided by the MSCL library. The package contains example VIs that demonstrate the basic functionality of the MSCL library. We provide many SubVIs that can be used to easily build applications that utilize both the simple and complex MSCL library features.

Install this package using the [JKI VI Package Manager](http://vipm.jki.net). The installation will add a `LORD Sensing - MicroStrain` sub-pallet to the standard Functions (block diagram) palette. Navigate through that palette to see the examples and available SubVIs.
