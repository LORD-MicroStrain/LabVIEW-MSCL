# LabVIEW-MSCL

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/LabVIEW-MSCL/releases/latest).

LabVIEW-MSCL is a VI package that provides an easy to implement LabVIEW interface to the .NET version of [MSCL](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/MSCL).

This add-on has helper VIs for many common methods and properties provided by the MSCL library. The package contains example VIs that demonstrate the **basic functionality** of the MSCL library. The provided SubVIs can be used to build applications that utilize both the simple and complex MSCL library features. While this does not provide example code for all of the MSCL functionality, a full version of MSCL is included, and all of its features can be accessed via the .NET MSCL dll.

If you have any questions or run into any issues, please let us know! [MicroStrain Support Portal](https://support.microstrain.com)
